   The <code>SVGImage</code> is a a JavaFX Group which is the result of the <ref id="SVGLoader" /> 
   <code>load</code> static method.
   
   <title title="overview" />   
   The <code>SVGImage</code> can be used directly in any JavaFX node graph. This class has also several additional methods
   which allows you to:
   <ul>
      <li>Get the JavaFX implementations of named SVG nodes</li>
      <li>Convert the Node content to a JavaFX Image</li>      
      <li>Produce a snapshot in a File in an ImageIO supported output format</li>            
   </ul>  
   
   <title title="limitations"/>       
   You will be able to use the direct methods to generate a snapshot only if you have swing available. If not, you will still
   be able to save the image using an alternate third party library to save the converted JavaFX Image on the disk. 
            
   <title title="threading usage"/>
   As for the <code>SVGLoader</code> class, you can use this class in the JavaFX Platform Thread or in any other Thread. 
   The library will make sure that the conversion will be performed in the JavaFX Platform Thread, and will return the result in 
   the calling Thread.
