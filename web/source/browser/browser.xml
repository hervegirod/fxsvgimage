   You can start the built-in browser by double-clicking on the <code>fxsvgBrowser.jar</code> jar file.
   <img id="browser" />
   
   <title title="menu" />
   The browser allows to:
   <ul>
      <li>Open a SVG file using the library</li>
      <li>Save the opened SVG file as a png of jpeg image</li> 
      <li>Refresh the currently selected image</li>     
   </ul>
   
   <title title="zooming" />   
   You can zoom or dezoom the image by using the mouse wheel or the zoom commands.
   
   <title title="Refresh the currently selected image" />   
   You can refresh the currently selected image by right clicking on the selected tab and select "Refresh". It can be useful if you have modified the 
   associated SVG file externally.
